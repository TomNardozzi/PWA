<font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to the fees charged by PWA, the client 
will be responsible for paying all fees charged by third parties and custodians.&nbsp; 
Possible fees include, but are not limited to: legal fees, tax return 
preparation fees, commissions on purchase and sale of securities, appraisal 
fees, custodial fees, trustee fees, banking fees, and wire transfer fees.&nbsp; 
The client is responsible for paying these expenses directly to whoever provides 
them with the additional services. &nbsp;PWA will not be the recipient of any of 
these additional third party fees.&nbsp; PWA is financially motivated to keep 
these costs as low as possible and commensurate with the service provided since 
a portion of PWA’s fees are based on assets under management (and excessive 
brokerage / custodian fees ultimately reduce the value of assets over the 
long-term).</font></p>
