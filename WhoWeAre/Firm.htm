Charlotte-based fee-only financial consulting firm.&nbsp; As is required by law 
for North Carolina-based advisors, PWA is a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) 
in the state of North Carolina.&nbsp; We are also registered in the states of 
Minnesota, Texas, Georgia, and California.&nbsp; (Note that we can legally 
accept clients from any U.S. state up to de minimus standards for that state and 
as required, we will register in additional states to serve additional clients).&nbsp; 
Registration of an Investment Advisor does not imply any level of skill or 
training.</font><font face="Verdana" size="1" color="#808080">&nbsp; </font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">PWA was founded in 2007 as a next-generation 
financial consulting firm.&nbsp; We stray from the traditional client-advisor 
product sales-focused relationship and instead seek to provide broad financial 
advice to a diverse group of clients.&nbsp; We feel there is a significant 
industry void in financial planning services that serve the middle and 
upper-middle class.&nbsp; We also believe there is a void in services that do 
more than just investment management or insurance sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We strive to provide unbiased, 
affordable, comprehensive financial consulting to all individuals regardless of 
their level of income or net worth.&nbsp; In short, we want to be the place you 
turn when you have questions, issues, or needs in any part of your financial 
life.</font></span></p>

products, take commissions, accept payment for referrals, or receive monetary 
compensation other than that provided by you for our services.&nbsp; Because we 
have structured our business in this way, you can be certain that the 
recommendations and services we offer you are for your benefit, rather than for 
the benefit of someone else who might be paying us a commission (i.e. if we 
recommend an insurance policy, you can be certain that we&#39;re not doing it b/c 
the insurance company will pay us a commission for getting you to take the 
policy).&nbsp; We believe the only successful client/advisor relationship is one 
based on trust and that the fee-only business model is one of the ways to build 
that trust.</font></span></p>
