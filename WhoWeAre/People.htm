<font face="Verdana" size="2">PWA is currently run by its founder and president, 
Mr. Thomas Nardozzi, CFP</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">®</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.&nbsp; 
An Ivy League graduate, Tom obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in 
Operations Research from Columbia University&#39;s School of Engineering and Applied 
Science, graduating second in his class.&nbsp; His coursework led him through a 
study of the theory and practice behind optimization, whether in a factory, in a 
computer program, or in a profitable business.&nbsp; His minor in Economics and 
concentrations in Finance and Engineering Management guided him into the 
business world where he worked as a management consultant.&nbsp; Tom used his 
business and optimization skills to help retail and retail software companies 
become more profitable, all the while continuing to gain experience managing 
investments for himself, his friends, and his family.&nbsp; After several of his 
colleagues began to ask him for financial advice, Tom&#39;s interest shifted from 
business consulting to personal financial consulting, and he decided to leave 
the management consulting world and explore financial advising.&nbsp; He spoke 
with a number of different people in the industry, and ultimately decided he 
didn&#39;t want to be a part of a business based in selling financial products and 
receiving commissions.&nbsp; Instead, he wanted to build a business grounded in 
trust, where he could use his knowledge and experience to help others run their 
financial lives the way successful businesses run their companies.&nbsp; In 
2006, Tom enrolled in a Certified Financial Planning program at Emory University 
and graduated at the top of his class in August of 2007.&nbsp; While doing so, 
he used his entrepreneurial spirit to found PWA and has continued to assist 
those who know him with comprehensive financial planning and investment 
management, now on a professional level.&nbsp; Tom has passed the national CFP 
exam and has proceeded to earn his CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification.&nbsp; 
Tom now truly loves what he does as he continues to build Perpetual Wealth 
Advisors into the financial advising firm people seek when they want to work 
with someone they can trust.</font></p>
