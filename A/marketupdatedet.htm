Dear Clients,<br>
<br>
With so much focus on the seemingly endless economic collapse that is happening 
around us I’ve been looking forward to begin able to send a more optimistic 
update for quite a while. Toward the end of 2008, I provided a few regular 
updates to all of you as events unfolded that led us into this decline. Over the 
last week, much has changed and while I’m sure it won’t get as much TV airtime 
as the bad news did, it’s just as important. Many of you know by now that the 
stock market rallied more than 7% today. This followed previous rallies over the 
past two weeks such that the market is now up more than 20% from its recent 
lows. Many regard the stock market as a view into what is around the next corner 
for the broader economy. This was certainly true last October when the credit 
markets froze, the stock market fell 25% in a week, and the real impact hit most 
people a few months later when layoffs rapidly accelerated. Similarly, I suspect 
the events of the last week, including today, will not be felt by Main St. until 
mid to late summer when those layoffs will slow down or cease. So, I wanted to 
provide a similar update to you now on what has changed, and why the market is 
reacting the way it did today.<br>
<br>
To some of you in our conversations, I’ve already described the announcement by 
the Federal Reserve last week as a “game-changer”. In case you don’t know what 
I’m talking about, let me summarize what the Fed said they’re going to do. First 
some background. We all know that the government is spending a ton of money 
right now and that we don’t have enough tax revenue to pay for it all. This is 
commonly known as “The Deficit”. Years of deficits have added up to a very large 
national debt of just over $11 trillion, or some $36,000 per U.S. citizen. The 
debt is financed by issuing government bonds called “treasuries”, which are 
purchased by individuals, corporations, and foreign nations. Because the U.S. 
has a very stable political system and has never defaulted on its debts in the 
past, it is considered credit worthy and lenders don’t demand a very high rate 
in return for their money. But, the deeper the hole we dig, the greater the 
interest that we have to pay on our debt. As that interest becomes a bigger and 
bigger slice of the tax revenue, it creates some risk that we might not pay our 
debts off. This risk would push interest rates up, just at a time that the 
government wants to keep them low for investment, refinancing, etc. So, we seem 
to have to choose between deficit spending (needed to turn the economy around) 
or low interest rates (also needed to turn the economy around). Quite the 
dilemma. Meanwhile, the recession continues to take its toll on asset prices 
(stocks, real estate, commodities, etc.). To put it simply, there is just less 
money out there than there used to be which means people can’t afford to pay 
what they previously could for similar assets. This creates a deflationary 
spiral where asset prices are falling because of the recession, and the 
recession is deepening because of falling asset prices. To combat this, the Fed 
announced last week that they will now be buying treasuries directly from the 
Treasury to finance the deficit, and mortgages directly from mortgage lenders to 
free up capital for new lending and keep mortgage rates low. Where will they get 
the money? Good question. Believe it or not, they’re just printing it.<br>
<br>
Printing money is highly inflationary. If we just double the amount of dollars 
in the economy, then we double the demand for everything which raises prices 
until it takes two dollars to buy what we used to be able to buy with one 
dollar. No one is wealthier, but because prices are rising so quickly, people 
start to hoard assets pushing up prices further, which can start an inflationary 
spiral. But, if we’re in a deflationary spiral now, putting some seemingly 
inflationary actions into play could break the spiral. If done carefully, we’ll 
end up perfectly replacing the lost wealth that is pressuring the economy which 
will put a floor under asset prices and return confidence to the normal buyers 
of those assets. In short, the recession will end and growth will be restored… a 
game-changer. Things won’t get better overnight, but for the first time in 
several months, I believe recovery is in sight and that the economy will begin 
to slowly stabilize over the next 3-6 months. Note that by stabilize I don’t 
mean the Dow returns to 2007 levels, that unemployment returns to 5%, that 
housing prices start increasing 10% per year, and that things feel “normal” (per 
2004-2006 expectations) again. I mean that stocks will stop falling, 
unemployment will stop rising, and we’ll have time to get used to the new normal 
(stable, sustainable, moderate growth). It’s likely that the stock market today 
and over the past couple of weeks senses this as well, and is pointing toward 
signs of recovery. <br>
<br>
In some additional good news, the Treasury today announced their long-awaited 
plan for handling illiquid mortgage-backed securities commonly known in the 
press as “toxic assets”. The plan includes a public-private partnership that 
will team up private capital, government programs such as TARP (the name for the 
$700 billion “bailout” that Congress passed in December), and the FDIC to 
purchase and create a market for these previously illiquid assets. Without a 
market to sell them, banks were forced to keep ownership despite their rapidly 
declining value and uncertain future. This in turn rattled investor confidence 
and prevented banks from raising new capital from private markets; hence the 
need for government bailouts. The details of the program make a lot of sense, 
with the private investors determining what price they’re willing to pay for the 
assets via an auction process, the government backing their investment in a way 
that will reward them for taking risk while also rewarding taxpayers alongside 
the private investors, and no penalties for banks that participate in a sale of 
their assets. As stated currently, this program should be another big positive 
for both the markets and the economy.<br>
<br>
Before we sound the “All Clear” signal, we have to realize that along with all 
the positives come some greater risks as well. Buying treasuries and mortgages 
is bold action by the Fed and while it is likely to end the recession in the 
medium term, if it’s not done carefully, it will lead to potentially bigger 
problems down the road. We could face runaway inflation, lost confidence in the 
dollar as a currency, and political tensions with other nations who suffer 
because our actions devalue the dollar that they own a ton of in the form of our 
debt (the financial engineering equivalent to highway robbery). The Treasury, 
the Fed, and the Federal government will all have to work together to cut 
spending, remove excess dollars, and reign back the flood of liquidity as soon 
as confidence is restored and the recession is over. If they don’t, $140 oil 
will seem like a bargain compared to the prices we’ll be paying in a few years!<br>
<br>
In addition to the risk of inflation going forward, there is another risk that 
is worth mentioning. The government is beginning to meddle in the private 
markets in ways that could hurt the willingness of corporations to do business 
with them in the future. Last week, the House passed a bill that would tax AIG 
bonuses at a 90% rate as a way of punishing the firm for paying bonuses after 
taking government money via the TARP program. While I think we can all agree 
that rewarding failure at the expense of the taxpayer is not what was intended 
by TARP, we have to be very careful in retroactively changing the rules on 
government programs. When TARP was passed there were no stipulations on how the 
money could be used. While the focus is on AIG who took the money to keep their 
business afloat, many firms took TARP money so that they could provide 
additional loans to homebuyers and businesses that needed credit. Now, the 
government is imposing additional rules on executive compensation for all 
companies that took TARP funds. If you change the rules in the middle of the 
game, it’s possible that no one will play with you anymore. In this case, many 
companies are now seeking to return TARP money which would cut off the added 
credit to the economy and reduce the effectiveness of the program. This 
government behavior could also cause skepticism of the new public-private 
partnership announced today. If there’s danger that participating banks may face 
new rules 3 months into the program, they may not want to participate at all. 
Congress needs to make sure that it writes all the rules ahead of the release of 
programs like TARP, and whatever those rules are, that it consistently enforces 
them without modifying them midstream. If we have a fair and consistent set of 
rules, which encourage participation in government sponsored programs to 
stimulate the economy, then those programs stand a chance of working. If not, 
we’re just wasting our time creating the programs that no one will use and the 
downward spiral will continue.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, let me be clear… I’m not claiming that the worst is over for the 
economy. There will be more layoffs, there will be more housing price declines, 
and there will be more foreclosures as the current damage flows through the 
system. But, over the next few months, these new programs and the lack of new 
damage will stabilize the economy and it will eventually begin to grow again. 
I’m also not claiming the stock market has necessarily bottomed. The short-term 
stock market is too unpredictable to say with certainty what will happen over a 
matter of days. But, IF the risks stated above are controlled, and that is a BIG 
IF, then I believe these plans are likely to stabilize the market. That is why 
we saw the gains we saw today and why we probably have seen the last of the 20% 
monthly market drops for a while.<br>
