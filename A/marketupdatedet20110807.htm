As you all know by now, S&amp;P downgraded U.S. long-term debt from AAA to the next 
notch down, AA+ on Friday night. Before digging too far into that, I’d like to 
reflect back on what happened this week, one of the worst for the stock market 
since the Lehman Bankruptcy era, to make sure you understand why there are far 
bigger issues out there than one rating agency’s opinion of our debt repayment 
prospects. I apologize in advance for the length of this message, but I’d rather 
provide you with too much information which you can choose not to read than to 
leave you wondering about what’s going on.<br>
<br>
On Monday of last week, we received the good news that the leaders of both 
parties in Congress had reached an agreement that would enable a majority of 
both the Senate and the House to pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling. The vote 
passed, the president signed the bill into law, and the crisis, if you believed 
there ever was one, was behind us. Markets initially rallied on the news as the 
general public had been told there was a chance of the end of the financial 
world stemming from a default on U.S. debt. When that chance disappeared, there 
was a lot of relief from those who believed it. Like I said in recent updates 
though, the debt ceiling was not a crisis, it was a political game using a 
completely irrelevant measure of how much debt we allow ourselves to have, 
rather than how much debt the market (i.e. our lenders) allows us to have. So, 
it didn’t take long for the markets to erase the “debt ceiling has been raised” 
gains and start to really worry about the banking system in Europe and the 
potential for a U.S. debt rating downgrade by the credit agencies. <br>
<br>
First, a quick explanation of what’s going on in Europe. Several countries in 
Europe have taken on too much debt, well more than the U.S. as a % of their GDP 
(though our trajectory will have us catching up too soon to be comfortable about 
it). The markets have started fear that lending more money to those governments 
is too risky unless there’s a high interest rate to go along with the loan to 
account for the chance of not being paid back. The higher interest rates lead to 
more interest payments as a percentage of the tax revenue these countries 
collect which strains their budgets farther and requires more borrowing. More 
borrowing means even higher rates, and eventually there is no way out of debt 
and the only answer is default. Who owns most of Europe’s debts? Generally 
speaking, the banks in Europe do. The story from here should sound very familiar 
as it’s much the same as what happened during our mortgage meltdown that caused 
the same stress on the financial system. If the bank holds something that is 
starting to look worthless, it can become insolvent, it can fail, and depositors 
as wells as other banks that have lent it money can be left in the dust. In a 
way, it becomes self-fulfilling. The fear that the bank could become insolvent 
removes depositors and stops lending to that bank which can in turn make it 
insolvent (see the history of Bear Sterns and Lehman for a deeper dive into the 
process). So, to stop the rapid downward spiral in our case, our government got 
involved. They essentially provided the liquidity that the banks needed to 
reassure lenders and depositors they weren’t going out of business, while they 
raised money privately so that the government could be paid back. Most of you 
now know this campaign as TARP. The market is hoping that something similar can 
be pulled together in Europe to temporarily save the countries that are in 
jeopardy of defaulting on their debts. It’s more difficult there though, because 
each country has its own government, but they don’t have their own currency. It 
would take a huge amount of collaboration in good faith by the countries who 
don’t have debt problems, led by Germany, to rescue the other countries and 
prevent a banking collapse and a collapse of the Euro. In return for the effort, 
the debtor countries have to respond by agreeing to stop their over-spending 
ways and stop adding more debt… essentially providing a plan that will get them 
off life support over the medium term. The details over the possible coordinated 
efforts and the austerity measures would make this email longer than I imagine 
you want to read, so I’ll just leave it with this: if Europe as a whole doesn’t 
come to the rescue of the countries in Europe, then Europe as a whole is in for 
far worse than what we’ve seen from the mortgage meltdown. In a globally 
integrated world like we have, a depression in Europe would spread fairly 
quickly across the Atlantic and hit our companies and employment prospects very 
hard. Many don’t realize this but the European economy as a whole is even bigger 
than ours. Start to project a major haircut in their production and consumption 
and that is why the stock market plunged last week, with some areas down more 
than 25% from their highs less than a month ago, and the broad market down more 
than 10%.<br>
<br>
Friday afternoon, there were rumors of a rescue package agreement in Europe and 
the stock market had a fairly dramatic turnaround. As of the time I’m writing 
this, the details have not be revealed, nor has the agreement’s existence been 
confirmed, but I have to believe there is a scramble going on to reveal some 
positive news before Asian markets open tonight and definitely before the U.S. 
market opens tomorrow. What happens this week is highly dependent on whether 
there is an agreement, and if there is one, whether the market believes it will 
work.<br>
<br>
Adding fuel to the fire now is S&amp;P’s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating on 
Friday night. There were rumors of the downgrade happening on Friday all week, 
and pretty strong ones on Friday morning. S&amp;P telegraphed the measure to allow 
markets to prepare so it wouldn’t be a shock to the system. My personal opinion 
is that this is the last straw in S&amp;P’s credibility as a rating agency (these 
are the same people who rated the mortgage-backed securities that went belly-up 
in our crisis as AAA in many cases). While my opinion of S&amp;P is not relevant, 
the market’s opinion of U.S. long-term debt is, and it’s far more relevant than 
S&amp;P’s opinion of U.S. long-term debt. A $14.3 Trillion market is made of so many 
people, institutions, and countries that to think S&amp;P has some crystal ball, 
research ability, or magical formula that the collective $14.3 Trillion worth of 
market of participants does not have, is ludicrous. We need S&amp;P to do the due 
diligence on individual companies and their sometimes hundreds of securities 
because there isn’t enough time in the day for every fund manager or individual 
to do the research on their own. But here, we’re talking about the U.S. 
government. Do we really think that China isn’t doing their homework on our 
ability to repay our debts before they decide to lend us a trillion dollars at 
2.5% interest for 10 years?!? There’s no doubt we’re on a bad fiscal path, no 
doubt. Without getting into political views, I think it’s also safe to say that 
our political system is showing signs of weakness as well. But the markets say 
we’re the safest thing out there. Add in our ability to print money as a last 
resort if we need it, which we could use to pay off debts at the cost of high 
inflation, and there’s just no more chance of default today than there was 
before the S&amp;P downgrade, and certainly not more chance of a default than 
during/after World War II.<br>
<br>
So what does it mean for the markets? Unfortunately, despite the fact that the 
downgrade was telegraphed and essentially priced into the market in advance, 
there are some short-term technical problems that can result from the actual 
downgrade. There are funds (pension funds, mutual funds, etc.) that have legally 
obligated themselves to hold AAA-rated securities for a certain percentage of 
the fund. If they hold long-term U.S. debt, they will be contractually obligated 
to sell. This forced selling could drive down prices of U.S. Treasuries which in 
turn drives up interest rates. Over the medium term, I believe others who aren’t 
contractually obligated to sell will see great value in treasuries at a higher 
rate and will swoop in to buy up all the Treasuries that the other are coughing 
up. Short-term though, the forced selling could create instabilities and 
dislocations in the market. Selling can beget selling and the spillover effects 
to other markets like the stock market can be severe. In addition to the forced 
selling, there is the problem that banks, states, government agencies, and 
municipalities rely on the Federal government as a last resort for funding. The 
government is now rated AA+, all those organizations who are AAA likely have to 
be re-rated lower. If you believe the S&amp;P downgrade, you can’t put your full 
faith in FDIC insurance, in social security, in Medicare, in Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac (who hold about 50% of the mortgages in the U.S.), or 
well-capitalized U.S. banks. Downgrades of all those entities could cause a 
domino effect on everything that relies on them. Trying to see the end of the 
line of downgrades due to this one is impossible.<br>
<br>
But, in thinking about it, I keep coming back to the same thing. There’s not a 
single entity today who has a lower chance of repaying its debts than last week. 
If that’s the core guiding principal, then everything else has to have at most a 
short-term impact. Dislocations in markets that cause violent reactions should 
have a snap-back effect as value is recognized by those who are not obligated to 
sell. Of course when dealing with markets like the stock market, we never know 
how long short-term will last and how long it takes to get back to something 
grounded in fact, value, and thought vs. rumor, momentum, and fear. <br>
<br>
In short, I’m not worried about the S&amp;P downgrade. What happens over the 
short-term is unknown. It could be very ugly. There’s a part of me that thinks 
that ugliness would be very short-lived and we could even see the market rise 
this week if Europe makes a credible announcement that would end their financial 
downward spiral. So, I’m watching Europe, way more than I’m watching S&amp;P’s 
opinion about something that $14.3 Trillion dollars have already decided. The 
U.S. bond market is safe and we remain one of, if not THE safest place to have 
money in the world.<br>
<br>
What we’re doing is preparing to rebalance all portfolios as triggers to do so 
occur. We don’t anticipate a negative response to short-term bonds which is what 
makes up much of the conservative portions of your portfolios. As stocks fall, 
if they fall enough, we will sell bonds and buy stocks to rebalance your 
portfolio back to its target. It is the same thing we did during 2008/2009 and 
the reverse of what we’ve been doing as the stock market rose 100%+ over the 
past 2 ½ years. This results in a natural buy low sell high rhythm that doesn’t 
require us to predict bottoms and tops in the market, something I know is 
impossible. 50% of everyone who makes and up or down prediction are going to be 
correct. You just can’t know ahead of time who they are or that they’ll be in 
the same 50% the next time. Note that this rebalancing strategy only works if 
your target allocation is aligned with your broader financial plan. I’m sure 
there are people out there (obviously not PWA clients) who are 6 months from 
retirement and have their 401k in funds that hold 90% stocks. I’m sure there are 
others who want to buy a house in a year and they have most of their liquid 
assets, needed for the downpayment, in individual stocks. They probably felt 
pretty good about their portfolio as little as 3 weeks ago but now there’s a 
chance they can’t buy that house all because their plan didn’t align with their 
portfolio. As Vanguard’s chief economist Joe Davis has said, “Treat the future 
with the humility it deserves.” Planning is a much better way to do that than 
gambling or hoping.<br>
<br>
I’ll send out another update (hopefully shorter) as events warrant. As always, 
if you have questions or comments on this topic or anything else, please don’t 
hesitate to ask.<br>
