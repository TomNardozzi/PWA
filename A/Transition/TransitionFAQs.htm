<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A1 – While there is no fixed timeline, my hope is to have
zero clients remaining by the end of Summer 2026.  Of course, there is work
involved in transitioning each client so the only way that can happen is for
some to leave earlier than others.  I anticipate some clients will transition
in Q4 2025, more in Q1 2026, and vast majority of the remainder in Q2 of 2026. 
Your preference will be the driving factor for your particular timing, though
if everyone wants to be last, I will need to nudge some toward the front of the
line.  We will agree on a termination date and complete termination activities
prior to your departure.</span></p>

finances without PWA?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A2 – You have several options, but they depend most on
what help you need.  PWA provides three major services: 1) Comprehensive
Financial Planning / Decision Support, 2) Asset Management, and 3) Tax
Preparation.  A more detailed list of what we do is provided in Q5, below.  If
you desire all of those services moving forward, you can either attempt to find
an advisor that provides all of them, or find different providers for each
service.  If you don’t need help in all those areas, then that means you’re
fulfilling one or more of the areas on your own and require less help from
advisor(s).  Which is best for you is completely up to you, but you should
decide what you’re looking for before you start your search for help.</span></p>

recommend?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A3 – Unfortunately, no.  I don’t know another advisor
that does what I do.  I do think they’re out there, but they are likely small
operations like mine, which doesn’t lend itself to popularity.  I also think
it’s more important that you find an advisor that you trust and that can serve
your needs, than for someone else to tell you who you should work with.   The
best place to look for a new advisor is via referral from family, friends, and
colleagues.  For the characteristics that I personally think are most
meaningful, please see Q7,  “What should I look for in a financial advisor”,
below. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A4 – There’s no way that I could successfully do that. 
As a policy, I will not participate in your search, conversations, or
interviews with other advisors.  I will speak with you and answer all of your
questions before, during, or after that search.  If there is information that
needs to be transitioned to a new advisor after you’ve signed on with them and
before you’ve signed off with me, I’m happy to be in direct contact with your
new advisor.  I just can’t be part of the selection process and can’t “bless”
your choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A5 – Yes.  I’ve brainstormed a pretty good list, but I
expect this document to grow as more comes to mind.  For this reason, I’ve made
it a separately accessible document on the PWA website.  You can find it </span><a

Preparation and the Tax portion of Financial Planning / Decision Support?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A6 – Yes, and it’s a big one.  Tax preparation is not Tax
Planning.  Your taxes are prepared after-the-fact, with no opportunity to
change anything.  Tax Planning is done in advance and guides you toward
optimization.  This is especially necessary when your financial situation
changes, when tax laws change, and in retirement when your taxable income in
any particular year is controllable.  If you hire an advisor that doesn’t do
Tax Planning, I recommend a Tax Preparer that does do tax planning (likely a
CPA, Enrolled Agent, or attorney), and who is willing to work with your other
advisors as necessary.  If you hire an advisor that does Tax Planning, but
doesn’t do Tax Prep, make sure they communicate with your Tax Preparer and
review what the Tax Preparer produces.  If you hire an advisor that does Tax
Planning and Tax Prep, there’s a lot less communication / coordination that is
necessary.  Of course, those folks are harder to find and may be more expensive
because they are in high demand and they require much less work from you.  </span></p>

in a financial advisor?</span></b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

encompassing, and I’m sure not everyone would agree with this whole list of
characteristics, but it’s what I would look for (in importance from most
important at the top):</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Trust
– it absolutely has to be someone you trust or the relationship won’t work.  To
me that means the person is at least one of the following: A) someone you
already know and trust, B) someone that comes highly referred by someone you
trust and that values similar things as you, C) someone you spend a lot of time
vetting yourself via conversation, research, etc.  I think long-term advising
relationships that are not grounded in trust are doomed to fail.  If you need
someone on a transactional or otherwise short-term basis, this may not be as
important, but if you want someone that’s going to truly advise you for years
on your personal finances, you better fully trust them, know they are ethical,
and know they are looking out for your best interest.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Knowledge
/ Experience / Credentials – a good advisor knows their stuff, specifically the
stuff that is relevant to you.  Maybe more importantly, they know what they
don’t know.  Years and years of experience with similar clients is a good way
to develop the knowledge necessary to serve you.  A solid education in personal
finance, along with continuing education to keep up with ongoing changes in
tax, investments, etc. is a good foundation for someone with less experience. 
Being a Certified Financial Planner ™ , a CFP® professional, tells you that the
advisor has met a rigorous education and exam component (hardest test I ever
took), has at least a few years of (broadly defined) experience in personal
finance, has agreed to follow a Code of Ethics, and is required to complete
continuing education annually.  Of course there can be poor CFP® professionals
and non-CFP® professionals can be fantastic advisors, but that credential seems
to increase the probability of getting a good one, and it seems to weed out
some of the bad guys that just can’t / won’t put in the work to pass the test.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Compensation
Method – I would avoid those that work on a commission basis.  Not all of them
are bad apples, but the incentive structure tends to promote high-cost products
that pay high commissions.  It’s pretty easy to think a product is awesome when
you are getting paid to do so.  It may also limit what they’re allowed to
recommend.  Instead, hire someone that works on a “fee-only” basis.  That means
the only payment they receive is what you pay tthem directly.  That can include
those who charge a percentage of assets under management, a flat quarterly or
annual fee, or by the hour.  All methods have their own conflicts of interest,
but I personally feel that paying commissions for products is much more
troublesome than paying a fee for service.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Proprietary
Products / Termination &amp; Surrender Fees – some proprietary products may be
fantastic, but once you buy into something proprietary to a firm, you generally
can’t get out.  What happens if you decide that advisor is not for you?  What
if you move?  What if they move?  What if you need your money for something? 
Similarly, products or relationships that hit you with fees to terminate or
undo the relationship / purchase can trap you, even if you realize you made a
mistake.  No one should be married to their advisor or a financial product
without a way to divorce that won’t cost an exorbitant amount.  Avoid
proprietary products, termination/surrender fees, or prepaying too much
up-front for anything.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Team
Size – whether it’s a solo advisor like me, a small office team, or a big
institution, you need to feel comfortable.  I can’t tell you which is best
here, because it really is up to you.  If you want to ensure you’re always
talking to the same person, that there’s someone that knows your story,
preferences, risk tolerance, family, goals, etc., then a solo or small shop is
probably best.  If it’s more important to you that <i>a</i> person is always
there when you need them, your teams never gets sick, goes on vacation, or
retires, or that you can be referred to in-house specialists for tax, estate
planning, etc., then an institution might be the way to go.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Comprehensive
– from my perspective, there is massive value to be gained in having your
investment person, tax person, and financial planner all be the same person. 
There’s no need to coordinate them.  There’s no risk of miscommunication
between them.  On the downside, everything is single-threaded through one
person, and if you don’t want/need all that that person does, you may be
overburdened by what they require of you or you may be paying for services you
don’t use.  You should determine what help you need and then determine whether
it should all come from one person / business or several independent people /
businesses.  The critical part here is realizing that for every part of
personal finance that you’re not outsourcing, you’re committing to doing it
yourself or to deal with the consequences of no one doing it.  If there is a
team of independent people doing work for you, you’re either playing captain
and coordinating them all or you need to find someone else to play that role. 
No team succeeds without a captain.</span></p>

make sure that an advisor is registered where they’re supposed to be and if
there are any regulatory violations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Some advisors have their
Form ADV Part 2 on their website.  Others require you to ask for it if you want
it in advance of signing an agreement with them.  Either way, get a copy of
it.  It will tell you about the business, services, and fee structure.  Ask
them about the business, services, and fee structure as well.  If what they’re
telling you doesn’t match their ADV Part 2, something isn’t right.  Compliance
is a pain for advisors, but if you can’t get that part right, it’s hard to
trust that you will get the more complex and important things right as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Finally, talk to potential
advisors before picking one.  Make sure their characteristics match your
preferences from the above list.  Ask them how long they’ve been in business,
who their typical client is, what they specialize in, if they’re part of a team,
how they’re compensated, and if they use proprietary products.  Ask about their
education, experience, hobbies, and family.  The more they talk, the more you
know, the more you will trust or not trust.  Likewise, make sure you tell them
what you want out of the relationship.  No advisor is going to say yes to
someone that’s going to demand things they can’t/won’t do.  It’s better for
everyone if you know what you want, you communicate that clearly, and they
respond with what they can / can’t do to meet your needs.</span></p>

you’d like before you go.  For retirement assets, maybe that’s a target date
retirement fund, or a balanced fund, which would minimize the rebalancing work
you need to do.  There are tax considerations in any liquidation of current
holdings in a brokerage account though, so this will need to be tailored toward
what you want and what you feel is best.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A10 – I can’t prepare taxes for 50+ clients between Feb 1
and April 15, 2026.  It’s just too much to do again.  I have purchased Tax Prep
software already though and can prepare some tax returns.  I can also prepare
extensions if necessary.  The short answer is that we will need to discuss
this.  Some of you will not be clients at the end of 2025 and I will not
prepare your taxes for 2025.  Others will be mid-transition in Q1 2026 and I
might be able to prepare your taxes.  Others will stay on through tax season,
and, if I usually prepare your taxes, I will most likely be able to prepare
them again.  Unless you make arrangements with me where I tell you I will
prepare your taxes for 2025, please assume that I will not.  Lastly, I will not
be able to help anyone that can’t get me their documents in a reasonable amount
of time, so for those that are staying on through tax season, expect tighter
deadlines and higher penalties than you’ve been used to in previous years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A11 – If you leave at the end of a quarter, then you’ll
receive an invoice for that quarter which will be billed to your accounts (or
paid by check/Zelle) as usual.  If you leave mid-quarter, you’ll receive a
final invoice for the portion of that final quarter that you were a client,
prorated by # of days as a client / # of days in the quarter.  For anyone that
completes the transition before Thanksgiving, 2025, I will waive that final
invoice.</span></p>

me, I’m easy) and continue doing what you’re doing?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>A12 - Many of you have asked this question in one form or
another.  I’m frankly overwhelmed by it.  I knew PWA was a big part of some
clients’ lives, but I didn’t know how many assumed I would be, and wanted me to
be, their advisor forever.  It breaks my heart to walk away, but this is
something I have to do.  Is it possible that I could find a way to keep a
handful of clients?  Maybe.  But, it would have to make economic sense (and
here are some big fixed costs in staying in business), it would have to require
a lot less time (and there are big fixed time requirements regardless of number
of clients), it would have to satisfy our custodian (Schwab doesn’t
particularly love tiny advisors with not a lot of assets under management) and
regulator (so many regulations in this business), and I’d have to establish
more guardrails to swing the work / life balance way more toward the life
side.  Right now, I don’t see a way to satisfy all those conditions, and I
don’t think any of you should plan for it to happen.  If I figure it out, I
will communicate that and open the door to a handful of people.  To be clear,
this seems unlikely at this point. </span></p>
