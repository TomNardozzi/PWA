<b>What in the world happened in the markets last week?</b><br>
<br>
Make no mistake about it, the US stock market crashed last week. It happened 
over five days instead of just one as it has happened in the past, but the broad 
US stock market (as measured by the S&amp;P 500) fell more than 23% from its closing 
value one week ago to the morning lows on Friday. Foreign markets in Europe and 
Asia actually faired worse, and emerging markets even worse than that. Panic and 
fear dominated as credit has become virtually frozen and companies, funds, and 
some individuals have been forced to liquidate portfolio holdings to free up 
cash that is badly needed. Forced selling leads to lower prices which leads to 
more forced selling and even more credit restrictions. It is a vicious cycle and 
the result is a loss on the order of $4 trillion dollars of aggregate wealth in 
the U.S. stock market. Additional circumstances likely contributed to the cause, 
like the unwinding of some complex derivatives (think of them as huge bets b/c 
that’s really what they are) that had to do with the Lehman bankruptcy and 
worsening economic data that has increased the probability of a technical 
recession in the U.S. and abroad. But for the most part, market action last week 
was based on emotion and fear rather than facts and events.<br>
<br>
<b>How did we get into this mess?</b><br>
<br>
Our banking system is built on leverage. For every dollar of assets that a bank 
has, they’re allowed to loan out $10 (that number isn’t exactly right and isn’t 
fixed, but it is determined by the Fed, and it’s the fact that they can loan 
more than they have that matters). As long as their loans continue to be repaid 
close to on schedule, the system continues to work. Banks have plenty of money 
to pay back deposits, provide new loans to individuals and other banks, and 
continue to do business. Some of the biggest loans that these banks own are 
mortgages. Many mortgages, for reasons I won’t get into, were given to people 
who never should have had them and who had no ability to pay them back over the 
long term. The thought was that as long as housing prices continued to rise, 
repayment risk really wouldn’t matter because if the borrower couldn’t pay their 
mortgage, they’d just sell their house for more than they paid for it, repay the 
loan, and move somewhere more affordable. When many of these risky loans are 
lent in the same time period, especially on an adjustable interest rate basis 
(which is what happened in 2001-2004), and those rates start to adjust upward as 
they are now, it puts pressure on a lot of people at the same time. They all 
start to try to sell their houses because they can’t pay their mortgages. That 
pushes house prices down because it floods the market with houses for sale. 
Pushing prices down scares more people who bought speculative investment 
properties and they start to sell as well, pushing prices down more. More scared 
people, who might have bought a house, now stay out of the market. Lack of 
demand means even lower prices. Now the people that can’t pay their mortgage 
can’t sell their house for more than they paid anymore. The only way out of the 
mortgage is foreclosure. This pushes prices down more and the cycle continues.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the banks that rely on these mortgages (and related products that are 
too complicated to describe here) start to lose a LOT of money very fast b/c 
they’re not getting their interest payments anymore and they’re losing huge 
chunks of principal through foreclosure. That ratio of assets to loans 
deteriorates and the Fed requires them to raise more capital to maintain a safe 
ratio. To do that they sell pieces of the company and some of their bad assets 
for less than they are worth (“fire sale prices”) to try to raise cash. By doing 
so, accounting standards require that similar businesses with similar assets 
have to mark down their assets to those prices immediately which puts pressure 
on their required assets to loans ratio forcing them to liquidate holdings as 
well. When all is said and done, there isn’t anyone left to put money into these 
companies b/c they’re all looking for money and in the same situation. If they 
can’t find the money, they’re forced into failure / bankruptcy which forces more 
asset sales through liquidation and puts pressure on the other banks again. This 
domino effect, if not stopped, could literally bring down all the institutions 
that the economy depends on for business loans, mortgages, car loans, credit 
cards, and investment products. While doing so, it would lay off millions of 
workers and force the rapid shutdown of the businesses that rely on credit to 
build and grow. That would cause lay offs of other workers and cut aggregate 
spending in the economy, hurt retail, cut more jobs and so on. The single source 
of strength in all of this is the government (as scary as that is). Both US and 
foreign governments have the capacity to end the cycle by providing liquidity to 
the markets so that loans/credit can continue to be obtained, and invest in the 
banks that caused the problem in order to keep them afloat and keep the banking 
system running. That’s what governments around the world are doing, but they 
have to do it in a careful way that takes a bit of time. While time passes, the 
problem gets worse. What you witnessed last week in the financial markets is the 
result.<br>
<br>
<b>Didn’t the government just pass a $700 billion package to prevent this from 
escalating?</b><br>
<br>
Yes, we authorized it, but we haven’t started using it yet. In order to make 
sure the $700 billion is used optimally, several vehicles have to be set up to 
allow the government to purchase distressed assets at appropriate prices from 
the banks and other institutions that may be looking to sell them. While this is 
being set up, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury continue to inject capital 
and provide liquidity to the markets through a variety of tools including 
complex short-term loans. Eventually, these injections of liquidity will unlock 
the credit markets because enough money will be available to meet the demands of 
borrowers.<br>
<br>
<b>When will end?</b><br>
<br>
In some ways, we may have already started to see the end of this crisis. The 
market rallied more than 5% from its lows on Friday morning before closing for 
the weekend. Gold, which is usually a safe haven in times of trouble, plunged 
when the market rallied back. These are good signs but the short answer here is 
that we really don’t know when it will end. Over the short-term, especially when 
panic sets in, the stock market is incredibly unpredictable. No one knows when 
it will bottom or if it already has. It’s very possible that we see an extreme 
rebound in the stock market over the short-term. By no means does that mean the 
economic turmoil or credit crisis is all behind us. However, the actions that 
our government has taken and the coordinated actions of governments around the 
world (like those coming out of the G7 meeting this weekend) will start to set a 
floor under panic-driven selling. The open question is, once the panic driven 
selling stops, how much damage will have been done to the economy and how long 
will it take to recover. <br>
<br>
<b>So how bad is it going to get?</b><br>
<br>
From an economic perspective, it could get pretty bad. Some industry experts are 
predicting the worst holiday season for retail sales since the popping of the 
tech bubble and subsequent economic turmoil after Sept 11th. The financial 
services sector has already seen, and will continue to see big layoffs from bank 
failures and merger activity. Unemployment is likely rise throughout the entire 
economy. Housing prices will likely continue to fall for some time as the 
inventory of available homes is simply too great when compared to the demand for 
purchases. Recession is almost a certainty. On the bright side, the cost of 
living appears to be decreasing for the first time in a long time. Energy prices 
have tumbled. On Friday, gasoline futures bottomed at $1.80 per gallon. When 
that flows through the system, it should translate into retail gasoline prices 
well under $3 / gallon, and potentially as low as $2.50 in some places. Food 
prices (corn, grains, meats, etc.) are also falling. As housing prices come 
down, the cost of buying a new home comes down with it. Investing in companies 
has become dramatically cheaper, and in a sense, 40% less risky since it costs 
about 40% less to purchase the same stock than it did a year ago. All of these 
things lay the groundwork for a strong economy in the future. Once the excesses 
of a rapidly growing economy that was fueled by greed and leverage are pulled 
out the system, there comes potential for a period of fantastic growth. This has 
happened again and again in our history, and will likely happen again. It’s just 
a matter of how long it will take, and how involved governments will be in 
facilitating (or blocking) a natural rebound through regulation.<br>
<br>
<b>OK, so what should I do now?</b><br>
<br>
From an investment perspective, you probably shouldn’t do anything different 
than what you were doing before this happened. If the money you need for 
long-term goals is in the stock market (as it probably should be), then this is 
just part of the volatility you have to accept in order to target long-term 
growth. In time, unless you believe the world will end or the U.S. economy will 
completely grind to a permanent halt, the markets will recover. For shorter term 
goals, your money should be more diversified with more and more of it in safer 
investments like bonds as the need for the money comes closer and closer to the 
present time. This means the stock market volatility won’t have as large of an 
effect on that money. During your upcoming reviews, we will re-evaluate your 
goals, the current funding for those goals, and your asset allocation to 
determine if any changes should be made in your allocation strategy. In the 
meantime, I’m taking care of keeping your portfolio in sync with the strategy we 
determined during the creation of your financial plan, and making sure we’re 
using the best funds possible to achieve your allocation.<br>
<br>
<b>Is there anything else I can do to get through this period and come out in a 
better position when it’s all over?</b><br>
<br>
Yes. Here’s a short list of recommended actions that would likely benefit 
everyone during this period:<br>
<br>
1) If you’re not retired and are depending on income from an employer, make 
yourself indispensable at work. Layoffs are coming in most industries. Make sure 
your boss would go out of his/her way to keep you off the layoff list by 
performing to the best of your ability. During times of layoffs, it’s often your 
performance during the past few months that counts most in deciding your fate.<br>
<br>
2) Make sure your emergency fund is well-funded. Cut back on discretionary 
spending if needed to make sure this is the case. The likelihood of needing it 
in the next year has increased as the economy has faltered. Now is the time to 
make certain your emergency fund will be there if you need it.<br>
<br>
3) Have a contingency plan. Think for a few minutes about your worst case 
scenario (job loss, retirement asset loss, etc.). What’s your first move if this 
happens tomorrow (is your resume up to date, do you have enough money to cover 
your basic needs, etc.)?<br>
<br>
4) Continue to make regular deposits to your goal-funding vehicles (401k, 
brokerage account, etc.). Prices are 40% cheaper on average than they used to 
be. Take advantage of this and continue to build toward your goals.<br>
<br>
5) Be exceptionally careful with employer stock holdings. We continue to see 
companies go out of business seemingly without warning. You do not want to lose 
your job and significant assets at the same time if your company experiences 
troubles. So, even if your stock is down from its highs, it probably makes sense 
to diversify it and spread the risk to other areas of the market.<br>
<br>
As I finish writing this update, US stock futures are up 3%+ from their close on 
Friday. While this is certainly no guarantee of a successful day tomorrow or an 
end to the turbulence, I believe it is a good sign. Wherever this week’s 
rollercoaster market takes us, I hope the knowledge of what’s going on helps you 
worry less about it. As always, please feel free to contact me if you have any 
questions or comments. <br>
