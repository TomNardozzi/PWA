• The End of QE - On 3/24/09, just after what we now know was the stock market 
bottom, I wrote in a “Market Update” note to clients that the announcement that 
the Federal Reserve was going to purchase U.S. Treasuries and other securities 
represented a “game changer” for the financial markets. Those purchases became 
known as Quantitative Easing (QE) with two distinct rounds of purchases being 
coined “QE1” and “QE2”. These were in fact a game-changer for the markets, with 
the S&amp;P 500 rallying more than 100% from March ’09 to April ’11. They were a 
game-changer because the Fed was, in simplified terms, printing money to buy 
financial assets which put that newly printed money into circulation to offset 
the deflationary spiral that was occurring (the value of everything from houses, 
to bank assets, to the stock market, to commodities was falling rapidly and 
simultaneously causing credit markets, job markets, and the overall economy to 
grind to a halt). As of July 1st of this year, the Fed ended QE2 and has 
signaled that a QE3 is unlikely. This means the game-changer is over. However, 
the Fed is not selling the assets they’ve purchased to date and they will keep 
reinvesting in those assets as they mature which means we don’t expect a 
game-changer in the other direction to send the markets back down. What we do 
expect is that the days of 50% per year stock market gains are behind us for 
quite a while. We also expect interest rates to start to gradually rise on 
medium to long-term treasuries and mortgages, though probably not sharply 
because any sharp increase would set the economy back and likely force more 
intervention from the Fed. In the next 12-months we expect short-term rates on 
savings accounts, CDs, and short-term bonds to start to gradually increase as 
the Fed hikes the Fed Funds rate back to something less extraordinary (we 
believe 2-3% would still provide support for economic recovery without risking 
the inflationary dangers of the 0% emergency rate we have today. Finally, we 
expect a higher level of volatility (up and down) in all financial markets as 
the Fed-induced tailwind is no longer behind us and now the economy, business 
cycle, productivity, earnings, and jobs will take more focus. <br>

• The Debt Ceiling - Much is being made of the U.S. debt ceiling and what might 
happen if it’s not raised and we’re unable to pay our bills. For the most part, 
this is political grandstanding. There is absolute certainty that the debt 
ceiling will be raised. But, there’s an important problem in the way Congress is 
currently dealing with the issue. August 2nd has been set as the “deadline” by 
the treasury secretary by which the ceiling must be raised in order to proceed 
with business as usual. For this reason, the credit rating agencies have to 
consider the possibility that the U.S. will not be able to pay its debts if the 
ceiling is not raised by that date. Ironically, Congress bashed the credit 
agencies for maintaining AAA status on collateralized debt obligations that 
later failed during the peak of the financial crisis, arguing that any risk of 
default should have caused an immediate downgrade of those instruments way 
before the crisis occurred. Those same credit rating agencies must now act 
accordingly and not wait until August 2nd to cut the U.S. rating or they risk 
having a AAA rating on August 2nd morning and a default rating on August 2nd 
evening. This means the real deadline to raise the limit is well before August 
2nd, because a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, if taken seriously by the 
world, will having a snowball effect through the financial markets and set off 
another deep, albeit temporary, financial crisis. The President’s comment that 
he will not approve a short-term extension, while obviously in good a faith 
effort to try to prevent this from being a recurring quarterly problem, actually 
worsens the situation because it makes the possibility of no deal by August 2nd 
more likely to the credit agencies. Congress is now playing a game of chicken 
and I expect a short-term deal is likely with an understanding of more 
short-term deals through the 2012 elections which will keep the ratings agencies 
at bay for now. In the meantime though, expect potentially violent moves in the 
markets, akin to those of the days of TARP being voted on, as momentum traders 
try to take advantage of the headlines. Since even a credit downgrade would be 
temporary (garnering a swift response in Congress if it ever did happen), market 
volatility due to these events is in my opinion, nothing more than an 
opportunity to rebalance portfolios taking advantage of dips in the market and 
to get a 401k or other savings contribution in at a cheaper price than without 
the debt ceiling issue. This issue will pass. The longer-term question of our 
government’s ability to govern if it’s willing to put us in these kinds of 
situations to begin with is a much broader issue but I’ll leave that discussion 
to those who enjoy politics.<br>

• European Sovereign Debt - A less-urgent, but much more important issue to 
long-term global financial markets is the vast amount of sovereign debt that 
exists in the world and the sudden realization by financial markets that some 
countries truly may not be able to pay their bills. This issue is not about an 
arbitrarily set debt ceiling. Countries like Greece and Ireland are struggling 
to pay their debts because they’ve taken on so much debt that tax revenues can’t 
support government spending plus interest payments any longer. These countries, 
with others like Italy, Portugal, and potentially Spain, not too far behind 
them, have simply lived on a national credit card for the last decade and are 
now forced with extreme austerity in return for global bailouts or default. 
Default means the loans made to those countries become worthless and the banks 
holding those loans lose the loans as assets. This has the potential to kick off 
a global financial crisis that is all too familiar after the ‘08/’09 Lehman 
Brothers default created much of the same. It can also kick off a currency 
crisis as it threatens the Euro, thereby strengthening the U.S. Dollar and 
causing harm in our own recovery as it makes our goods, services, and assets 
seem more expensive to the rest of the world. So far, rescue packages from the 
International Monetary Fund have staved off default for Ireland &amp; Greece, but 
this warrants further monitoring. There are three important actions to take 
here:<br>
o Like others, we have no crystal ball and believe that markets price 
information and risks fairly in general. That means that in most cases the 
market would fall before we have reason to believe it would fall or it would 
rise before we have reason to believe it would rise meaning there is no way to 
time news events. However, as I’ve discussed with all of you at one point or 
another, if I hear the whisper of a freight train coming, and sometimes it comes 
without making a whisper first, I will take corrective action. This means moving 
all models temporarily to a slightly more conservative allocation or using other 
protective measures as I see fit. <br>
o It’s easy to be complacent when the stock market is rallying like it has for 
the better part of the last 28 months. If you have short-term needs for your 
money that is currently invested as if it was not needed for the short-term, 
please communicate that need to me ASAP. If your portfolio is 80% stocks and the 
stock market falls 50%, which has happened twice in the last decade, you will 
lose ~40% of your portfolio. For long-term money, by definition, you don’t need 
it over the short-term so that’s not an issue. In that case, continue to invest 
as planned, buying at lower prices if markets fall and when markets eventually 
recover you’ll actually be better off than if the fall hadn’t happened. For 
short-term money though, that kind of a loss could mean not being able to 
fulfill a goal and goal-fulfillment is the only reason to invest.<br>
o Expect the market to move both up and down. Many have become accustomed to 
seeing their portfolio balances only increase, and quite sharply quarter after 
quarter. Don’t be shocked to see more volatility. As long as you’ve heeded the 
point in the preceding bullet, and you have an overarching financial plan, don’t 
worry about the short-term movements of the markets. The only ways to ensure 
that your account statements will only show increases in value are to 1) keep 
your money in the bank earning slightly more than 0% per year in interest while 
the cost of living increases far faster, or 2) have a crooked financial advisor 
that’s cooking the books (and we all know how that ends… google “Bernard Madoff”).<br>
