I don&#39;t live in the state of North Carolina.&nbsp; Can I still be a PWA client?</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. Yes.&nbsp; PWA is registered in North Carolina 
because that is the location of our office.&nbsp; We are also registered in 
Minnesota, Texas, Georgia, and California since we have more than five clients 
from those states.&nbsp; We are allowed to serve clients in other states up to 
de minimus standards (legal minimums).&nbsp; In most states, that means we can 
have up to five clients without registering in that state.&nbsp; When required, 
we will register in additional states to serve additional clients.&nbsp; Please 
note that registration of an Investment Advisor does not imply any level of 
skill or training.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Q. How will we communicate if we don&#39;t live in the 
same area?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. Communication is generally done via phone or 
email for those that live too far from our offices to meet in person.&nbsp; 
Administrative paperwork and data gathering forms are sent via email or regular 
mail.&nbsp; Consultations, question / answer sessions, plan reviews, and annual 
reviews are done via phone.&nbsp; Of course if clients are ever in the Charlotte 
area, they&#39;re always welcome to drop by!</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">Q. Is PWA certified?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. Financial planning companies can&#39;t be 
certified.&nbsp; However, financial planning practitioners can.&nbsp; And yes, 
PWA&#39;s president, Tom Nardozzi, is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional or 
CFP® professional.&nbsp; Please reference this <a href="../Articles/WhyCFP.htm">
article</a> for more information on why certification is important.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">Q. How much do your services cost?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. See the cost of each of our offerings as well 
as sample pricing scenarios on the
<a href="../WhatWeOffer/ServicesSummary.htm#Pricing">summary page</a> of the 
What We Offer section of the website.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Q. How long does it take to create a plan?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. That depends on how complicated your situation 
is and how fast you can fill out the administrative and data gathering forms.&nbsp; 
Once we have all your information, we can usually deliver a completed plan in 
1-2 weeks.&nbsp; Actual time spent on the plan is dependent on the complexity of 
the plan itself.&nbsp; Plans for couples take longer than plans for individuals 
because there are two people involved which may include two employers, two 
401ks, two sets of IRAs, etc.&nbsp; Plans for self-employed generally take 
longer than plans for employees.&nbsp; Plans for people with a lot of assets 
spread across varying accounts and account types are more complicated than those 
with less.&nbsp; Most plans can be completed in 8-16 hours, but extremely 
complex situations could take longer.&nbsp; We will give you an estimate, 
including a maximum (do not exceed) number of hours prior to starting your plan 
so that you know the maximum cost ahead of time.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Q. As far as money management goes, how does that 
work?&nbsp; Do you gather assets or simply advise?&nbsp; If the latter, do you 
perform audits to make sure your clients are doing what they&#39;re supposed to?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. We recommend that clients open an account in 
their name at Schwab and provide PWA with trade-only access via a Trading 
Authorization agreement.&nbsp; Under this arrangement, PWA has no access to the 
actual funds, and no ability to make withdrawals, just access to trade and (if 
authorized by you) to debit the account for management charges.&nbsp; For 
clients that find pleasure in trading in the market too, we suggest a separate 
account with a small stake that they can manage on their own.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Q. What about access to 401k, savings, etc? </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. The way we charge for asset management is a % 
of the assets we&#39;re managing.&nbsp; Pure cash savings are usually outside of 
PWA&#39;s scope b/c we generally can&#39;t add value there (exception if we&#39;re holding 
cash in an investment account to temporarily avoid being in a portion of the 
market or as a fixed income component when appropriate).&nbsp; We generally 
recommend a 3-6 month emergency fund (50% in cash) as the standard cash 
component of client finances.&nbsp; We can also manage or advise on retirement 
plans either through a website, or we can instruct clients on what to do and let 
them execute the transactions, sending us periodic statements.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Q. This all sounds great, but I don&#39;t have many 
assets so there&#39;s no point to having a financial advisor, right?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">A. No, that&#39;s not right.&nbsp; At PWA, we&#39;re not 
only looking to help those who already have established significant assets.&nbsp; 
We&#39;re also interested in clients that haven&#39;t achieved their goals yet, but who 
want to put some structure into a plan to get there.&nbsp; We take pride in 
helping everyone get from where they are today, to where they dream to be 
tomorrow.&nbsp; The earlier you start the better since if you don&#39;t already have 
significant assets, it&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ve made costly mistakes in setting up 
your finances.&nbsp; Bring us a clean slate and we&#39;ll help you build the assets 
over time.&nbsp; We&#39;re willing to invest in you, even if you don&#39;t have anything 
to invest with us initially.&nbsp;
<a href="../GetStarted/GetStarted.htm">Get started</a> now and as you do build 
wealth, you&#39;ll already have an advisor who knows you and you can trust.</font></p>
