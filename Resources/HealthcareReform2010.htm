&nbsp;<br>
Whether you support the current Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or 
not, it became law last week as President Obama signed the bill that had been 
previously approved by the House and the Senate. There are still some pieces 
that must be added and signed through the Health Care and Education 
Reconciliation Act, but that too has been passed by the House and the Senate and 
is on the fast track to become law. Some love it, some hate it, but very few 
know what’s really in the bills/laws. Here we’ll take a look through the 
provisions in the new law and in the reconciliation bill. Keep in mind that as 
with all new laws, the implementation methods are still to be determined. Some 
states have also already threatened to challenge the law on the basis of 
unconstitutionality, so some things may change, but for now, here are the key 
provisions we’ve gathered:</font></p>
