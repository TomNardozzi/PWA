<font face="Verdana" size="2">Risk management is the process of analyzing 
exposure to risk and determining how to best handle such exposure.&nbsp; In many 
cases, the solution to managing risk is purchasing insurance or hedging.&nbsp; 
But, in other cases, the appropriate form of risk management is to do nothing.&nbsp; 
PWA helps you decide the strategy that is right for you.</font></p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the easiest ways for a financial plan to 
fail to achieve its goals is to fail to properly manage the risk associated with 
the components of that plan.&nbsp; You could have been successful in saving for 
a down payment on your dream house for 5 years, only to accidentally injure 
someone in an auto accident and get sued for a million dollars in punitive 
damages (most people don&#39;t realize that their auto liability insurance may only 
cover the first $100,000 of that award).&nbsp; So much for that house.&nbsp; Now 
you&#39;re looking for a bankruptcy attorney instead.&nbsp; There are numerous 
threats to a financial plan.&nbsp; In order to minimize the risk of failure, 
they must each be addressed.</font></p>

Do We Do It?</font></span></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">We examine your current situation and lifestyle 
and determine the threats to your financial goals.&nbsp; Some of these threats 
would be catastrophic in nature (income provider dies, the auto accident 
described above, etc.).&nbsp; Others would be minor.&nbsp; Some have a high 
probability of occurring, others a low one.&nbsp; The principles of risk 
management help to decide what to do about particular risks.&nbsp; Consider the 
chart to the right which segments threats into four potential categories:</font></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">High probability / High Severity - these 
	threats are potentially catastrophic to the plan if they occur, and they are 
	likely to occur often.&nbsp; Examples are car accidents if you drive drunk, 
	or home damage if you live in hurricane prone areas.&nbsp; The proper risk 
	management strategy here is to avoid exposure to these threats by changing 
	behavior (i.e. don&#39;t drive drunk or live in hurricane areas).</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">High probability / Low Severity - these 
	threats occur often, but are unlikely to be very costly in nature on their 
	own.&nbsp; An example is living in NYC and having your hubcaps stolen from 
	your car.&nbsp; The solution is typically to think of a way to reduce the 
	risk without avoiding the behavior.&nbsp; You&#39;re not going to move from New 
	York over hubcaps but you could buy a device that locks the hubcap to the 
	wheel.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Low probability / Low Severity - these threats 
	are very minor in nature.&nbsp; They don&#39;t occur often and when they do, 
	they&#39;re not severe.&nbsp; Examples are door dings to your car, or road wear 
	to your tires.&nbsp; The risk management strategy is to accept the risk and 
	do nothing.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Low probability / High Severity - these are 
	the threats that are managed well through insurance.&nbsp; They occur 
	rarely, so we don&#39;t want to avoid the activity altogether, but when they do 
	occur, they can be catastrophic.&nbsp; To stay with the car example, this 
	type of threat would be a car accident while driving to work.&nbsp; We don&#39;t 
	want to stop driving all together, and there&#39;s not much besides defensive 
	driving we can do to avoid the accident.&nbsp; So instead, we pay an 
	insurance company and transfer the risk to them</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">We help you manage these types of decisions as 
well as those pertaining to your portfolio, retirement, and estate.&nbsp; Some 
threats are handled through insurance, some through hedging, some through proper 
planning, and others through behavioral change.&nbsp; In the case of insurance, 
we&#39;ll analyze the need for life, health, disability, long-term care, homeowners, 
auto, and umbrella policies.&nbsp; We do not believe insurance is the best 
risk-mitigation strategy in all cases, but it is necessary in some.&nbsp; We&#39;ll 
also manage your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and employ financial 
techniques that can limit or reduce (but never remove) your downside risk.&nbsp; 
Would you be willing to sacrifice approximately 1% of your return each year to 
guarantee your stock portfolio never falls by more than 20% in any given year?&nbsp; 
Some people may, but it&#39;s unlikely that a stock broker or asset manager focused 
on maximizing your return would ever off you that opportunity to hedge (which is 
a real opportunity in the options market).</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Managing risk is one of the more difficult things 
for most people to do.&nbsp; The natural reaction is to avoid the activity that 
introduced the risk, or ignore the risk totally.&nbsp; Many people are hesitant 
to buy insurance because they&#39;re afraid of being scammed.&nbsp; Having an 
unbiased advisor that doesn&#39;t profit from your policy decisions and who isn&#39;t 
incented to take extraordinary risks in your investments can be beneficial not 
only to your finances, but also to letting you sleep peacefully.&nbsp; PWA is 
that unbiased advisor, and we want to help you.</font></p>
