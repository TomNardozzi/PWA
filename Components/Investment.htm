return.&nbsp; Investments are those things to which we commit our capital.&nbsp; 
The Investments component of the PRETIRE program plans for efficient management 
of your assets based on your goals, implements the plan subject to your risk 
tolerance, and monitors progress such that changes can be made as they are 
warranted.</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Either you or one of your ancestors worked very hard to build the assets you 
possess today.&nbsp; Odds are that you're still working very hard to protect the 
assets you have and accumulate 
more of them.&nbsp; Investing is a way to make your hard-earned money make more 
money on its own.&nbsp; As you progress through your life, you'd like to see the 
percentage of your annual expenses that are satisfied by working shrink.&nbsp; 
This means the portion satisfied by your investments is growing, ultimately to 
100%.&nbsp; At the point where income earned from investments can support 100% 
of your expenses, you've reached PRETIREment and are free to &quot;work&quot; or 
not work in whatever career / industry / opportunity you like, on your own 
schedule and only answering to yourself.&nbsp; </font> </p>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to manage your own investments, you not only need the time, knowledge, 
and inclination that you need for other components of the program, but you also 
need the stamina and patience to weather down markets.&nbsp; Investment 
performance is cyclical, going through bull and bear markets over time.&nbsp; 
Individual investors have been known to plow money into a market that is doing 
well, just in time to see it turn around.&nbsp; They sometimes hold on much of 
the way down in hopes of a comeback, only to finally give in and capitulate near 
the bottom, selling much of what they have in a flight to safety just before the 
market turns up again.&nbsp; As an example, take a look at the charts below.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The charts show the results of a study done by Morningstar that calculated the 
returns of stock funds over the a 10-year period vs. the returns received by 
investors in the fund during that same period.&nbsp; The chart on the left 
demonstrates the result for World Stock funds, showing that investors earned 
almost 4% less than the funds themselves because they (on average) bought toward 
the highs and sold toward the lows.&nbsp; The chart on the right shows the even 
more dramatic result for Tech Stock funds, with an almost 10% difference.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Still not convinced?&nbsp; A study performed by Dunbar, Inc. showed that over 
the 20-year period from 1987-2006, U.S. equity investors experienced an annual 
4.3% return on avg vs. the 11.8% return for U.S. equities (as measured by the 
S&amp;P500).&nbsp; The results are even more dramatic in fixed income with investors 
returning an annualized 1.7% vs. long-term government bonds which averaged an 
8.5% return.&nbsp; This evidence gives further support to the theory that the 
average investor invests in stocks near their highs, and flees the stock market 
for bonds near their high, just as stocks are about to turn around.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is human nature to lack discipline in sticking to a plan if you don't have 
confidence in it.&nbsp; And, it's impossible to have confidence in a plan if you 
lack the expertise to create it, and the time to implement it.&nbsp; Those 
investors who pick stocks on their own, or even those who decide to jump into 
the S&amp;P500 index fund, do so feeling pretty good about their decision when the 
market is doing well.&nbsp; But, because they're not truly confident that their 
plan will earn the returns they need to achieve their financial goals, they can 
easily panic and lose discipline on a down cycle.&nbsp; PWA makes sure that the 
strategy employed to manage your portfolio is disciplined, and we're always 
there to remind you of that strategy when you need it.</font></p>
