What Is It?<img border="0" src="../Images/General/goal_1.jpg" width="164" height="277" align="right" hspace="10"></span></font></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Planning and goal setting is the process of 
documenting your life goals and determining a financial strategy that will 
enable their achievement.&nbsp;
<span class="body">Life goals can include buying a home, saving for your childâ€™s 
education, or starting your own business, among many others.&nbsp; There&#39;s no 
limit to what you may want to achieve in life.&nbsp; With proper planning, 
enough time, and efficient execution, your dreams can become a reality.&nbsp; 
The earlier you start planning, the better your chances of fulfilling those 
dreams.</span></font></p>

Is It Included In The Program?</font></span></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Planning and goal setting are the starting point 
for any successful project whether it&#39;s business related or personal in nature.&nbsp; 
PWA requires that a plan be in place prior to executing any of the other 
components of the PRETIRE program.&nbsp; It just doesn&#39;t make sense to jump into 
execution without knowing what you&#39;re striving for.&nbsp; The perfect example is 
in investments.&nbsp; You might say that an advisor can attempt to maximize 
return for a portfolio without knowing who owns the portfolio.&nbsp; That&#39;s 
definitely one approach.&nbsp; The issue with it is that investment returns are 
contingent on exposure to risk.&nbsp; Simply maximizing returns without any 
constraints on risk puts the portfolio in jeopardy.&nbsp; The advisor who 
attempts to manage in this way has no real downside (other than lost clients if 
the risk exposure blows up).&nbsp; After all, it&#39;s your money, not your 
advisor&#39;s.&nbsp; Instead, PWA works with you to create a plan that targets a 
return and includes your risk tolerance.&nbsp; This allows us to develop your 
portfolio with your goals in mind and your risk preferences addressed.&nbsp; The 
example is easily extended into the other PRETIRE components.&nbsp; You must 
have a plan in order to successfully implement a financial strategy.</font></p>

Do We Do It?</font></span></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Deep down inside, we all know what we want out of 
life.&nbsp; The problem is that we get so busy doing our daily routine, we lose 
sight of why we&#39;re doing that routine and what we should really be doing 
instead.&nbsp; Within PWA&#39;s program, you will take the time to document your 
goals and then talk through them with your advisor.&nbsp; We will help you 
rationalize those goals given your current situation and the time you have to 
achieve them.&nbsp; Once we understand where you want to be and have enough 
information about the present, we will generate a step by step plan (the action 
plan) to get there.&nbsp; Of course that&#39;s not the end of planning.&nbsp; There 
will always be changes to your needs, desires, and situation since no one lives 
in a static world.&nbsp; PWA provides continuous guidance as the unexpected 
changes to your life rear their ugly head.&nbsp; The action plan will be updated 
regularly and each task will be assigned to either you or your advisor.&nbsp; 
Your list of tasks will be sent to you so that you know exactly what you should 
be doing (i.e. so that they don&#39;t get lost in the monotony of daily activity).&nbsp; 
The action plan provides the structure necessary to &quot;uncomplicate&quot; the execution 
of the plan.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">There are tons of books, magazine articles, 
internet sites, and software packages that can help you do your own financial 
planning.&nbsp; Some even come highly acclaimed by industry professionals.&nbsp; 
But, you may still decide you need help from a financial 
planner/advisor/consultant if:</font></p>

	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">you realize you don&#39;t have the expertise

	code).</font></li>
<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">you don&#39;t have time to create your own financial

<font face="Verdana" size="2">you&#39;ve had a life-event that presents an immediate 
need which you can&#39;t solve in the required timeframe.</font></li>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Everyone <u>can</u> plan, execute, and monitor 
their financial strategy on their own, just like they <u>can</u> provide their 
own medical attention and legal support.&nbsp; The question is, do you have the 
time, knowledge, and inclination to be your own advisor?&nbsp; When it comes to 
medicine and law, the answer for most people is no.&nbsp; In the case of 
managing your finances in a way that enables your life&#39;s goals, do you <u>want</u> 
to invest the time, learn the material, and do it yourself?&nbsp; If not, we 
want to do it for you.</font></p>
