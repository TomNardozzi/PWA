<font size="2" face="Verdana">Retirement is the stage of life that follows PRETIREment for most people.&nbsp; 
It's the stage where you completely stop working and need to rely on alternative 
forms of income to pay your expenses.&nbsp; Retirement Planning is the process 
of establishing a retirement income goal and gathering information about your 
potential sources of retirement income.&nbsp; The information is then used to 
help determine if your projected retirement cash flow is adequate to fund your 
needs.&nbsp; </font> </p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, most of us want to completely stop working at some point in our 
lives.&nbsp; We want to be certain that when we do, we'll have enough assets to 
live out our life happily.&nbsp; Planning for the point in time when you will 
never again have an income is stressful for many people.&nbsp; It's difficult to 
see your retirement lifestyle when it's 30 years away.&nbsp; 
Add the complexity of trying to predict your ability to save over the next 30 
years, the performance of your investments, and all the events that will take 
place in the course of every day life and the task becomes well more than a 
challenge.&nbsp; PWA includes retirement planning in the program because our 
knowledge and tools can help you determine what you'll need and then simulate a 
series of events that will let you know if you're on the right track to get 
there.&nbsp; </font> </p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">The retirement planning component of the program helps 
you determine the amount of expenses you'll have during retirement to live the 
lifestyle you'd like to lead.&nbsp; Using your current personal profile and 
goals along with historical investment data, we then calculate the amount of 
wealth you'll need to have by your target retirement date.&nbsp; Once we know 
what you need and when you need it, we help you determine a plan for getting 
there through taxable investments, tax-deferred retirement accounts, and 
tax-free investments / accounts.&nbsp; We target a particular amount of 
liquidity at the different stages of your retirement so that you can continue to 
experience moderate growth of your investments in the portion of your portfolio 
that is dedicated to serving your needs in a particular timeframe.&nbsp; Once we 
have the plan in place, we use technology to simulate the results of the plan as 
if it were executed multiple times.&nbsp; We can derive the probability of 
future success given your present situation and our plan for the future.&nbsp; 
We monitor that probability of success as events change and time passes, and 
adjust the </font>plan as needed to keep you on track.</font></p>

<img border="0" src="../Images/General/glidepath.gif" width="173" height="149" align="right">Most 
people can do all the calculations necessary to determine the amount they should 
be saving for retirement.&nbsp; Even if you can't, it's easy to find a book or 
article with instructions on how to do so.&nbsp; The problem is that retirement 
planning isn't a one-time task to be accomplished using average performance 
information.&nbsp; Due to the volatility of investment performance and of 
ordinary life events, the only way to know whether you're retirement plan is 
solid and that you're on track is to simulate it's execution (incorporating the 
volatility) multiple times and determine the probability of successful results.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">In the aerospace industry, pilots who are landing a plane are taught to keep 
their approach to the runway in something called the &quot;glide path.&quot;&nbsp; This is 
the range of altitude that makes for a safe approach given that you're a certain 
distance from the runway.&nbsp; Think of that airplane coming in for a landing.&nbsp; 
It's analogous to you and your finances coming in for retirement.&nbsp; While 
the plane doesn't need to be at any particular altitude at any point in the 
landing sequence, there is a glide path that will enable a safe landing.&nbsp; 
PWA has the knowledge and instrumentation that gets you into that 
glide path and makes sure you land at retirement safely.</font></p>
