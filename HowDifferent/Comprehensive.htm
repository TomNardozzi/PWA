<img border="0" src="../Images/General/HandsWithPuzzle.jpg" width="250" height="233" align="right" hspace="10"><font face="Verdana" size="2">PWA doesn't specialize in only one 
area of financial planning.&nbsp; We play the role of general financial 
practitioner, serving your needs in planning, risk management, employee 
benefits, tax, investments, retirement, and estate planning.&nbsp; While there 
are other comprehensive financial advisors out there, many companies that call 
themselves advisors only focus on or two of these aspects.&nbsp; You may have 
experience working with some of them:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Stock Broker - eager sells you 
	stocks (since he's typically getting a commission per transactions).&nbsp; 
	Thinks that if the stock is &quot;undervalued&quot;, its a good investment for you.&nbsp; 
	Usually doesn't consider your risk tolerance, retirement plans, tax 
	implications, etc.&nbsp; He gives you advice, but it's usually not tailored 
	to your needs.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Insurance Agent - eager to sell 
	you insurance, especially life insurance.&nbsp; Uses life insurance as an 
	investment vehicle, even if there are better ways to invest your money.&nbsp; 
	Usually pushes permanent, complex (high-commission) policies that you don't 
	understand and doesn't have knowledge of alternate investments.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Financial Planners - many do very 
	detailed, complex financial plans, at costs usually over $200/hr&nbsp; They 
	take the time to get to know you so that then can produce an accurate plan 
	(after all, you're paying by the hour), but if they only focus on planning, 
	they send you to others to implement the plans and continue to charge you 
	hourly if you need their involvement.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Stock Pickers - while many are 
	very talented, their goal is simply to beat an index and/or perform better 
	than their pears.&nbsp; They aim to earn a return, potentially by taking big 
	risks, that may not be commensurate with what your financial situation 
	demands.&nbsp; On top of that, studies have shown that most stock pickers 
	cannot consistently beat their benchmark index.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Passive Asset Managers -&nbsp; 
	index-oriented investors who believe the market is always right and that 
	there are no opportunities to achieve better than market results (generally 
	correct).&nbsp; While these professionals generally do understand your risk 
	tolerance and goals to create an asset allocation that is right for you, 
	they generally only focus on asset management and have a tendency to ignore 
	the other facets of advising.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Tax Advisers - typically 
	concerned with minimizing the amount of taxes that you pay vs. the 
	comprehensive advisor who's goal is to maximize your net worth (or even more 
	generally, your long-term happiness).&nbsp; Tax is a consideration in 
	decision making, but for tax advisors, frequently it's the driver.</font></p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Estate Planners - specialize in 
	legal documentation (wills, trusts, etc.), and administration of estates.&nbsp; 
	But, because of their high hourly rates, people don't always take the time 
	to paint a clear 
	picture of what they desire from an estate planning perspective and the 
	result is incomplete documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</font>
	</p></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">401k Consultants - the companies 
	that send you a statement in the mail with your 401k statement stating that 
	they've analyzed your holdings and generally feel you're exposed to too much 
	(or too little) risk.&nbsp; They offer to manage and rebalance your 
	portfolio for you based on their calculations, but they know nothing about 
	your goals or other financial assets.</font></p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">This list goes on and on.&nbsp; And, 
while many of these professionals are credible and are good at what they do, 
they cannot achieve the synergies associated with having a single representative 
who knows you, managing your financials.&nbsp; Have you ever tried to get your 
investment &quot;guy&quot; to talk to your tax prep &quot;guy&quot; and been in the middle of that 
conversation?&nbsp; If you have, you now understand the value of having a 
comprehensive advisor in PWA.</font></p>
