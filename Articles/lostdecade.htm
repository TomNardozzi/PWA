The following is an excerpt from the Q1 2010 PWA Newsletter regarding the 
so-called &quot;lost decade of investing&quot;, a term used by much of the press to 
describe the performance of the stock market during the 2000's.&nbsp; If you are a client, prospective client, or any other 
interested party, please feel free to contact us at
<a href="mailto:contact@perpetual">contact@perpetualwealthadvisors.com</a> with 
any questions or comments.<br>

<font SIZE="2">
<p>The gloom-and-doom crowd has already taken a stance that the 2000’s were the 
lost decade for stocks as evidenced by the miserable performance of the S&amp;P 500, 
the most popular market-weighted benchmark for U.S. stocks. A chart of the S&amp;P 
500 from 2000-2009 backs up their point quite nicely. </p>
<p>As the chart below shows, the S&amp;P started the decade at 1,469 and ended it 
24% lower at 1,115. Obviously, a terrible return. If we use this as evidence 
that investing in the 2000’s was a losing proposition, we might reach the 
conclusion that a passive approach to investing over the long term or a 
goals-based approach to investing are dead. But, there are three fundamental 
points that are excluded from this argument. </p>
</font>
<p><img border="0" src="lostde1.gif"></p><font SIZE="2">
<p>First, the chart completely ignores dividends. Adding the dividends that the 
S&amp;P 500 companies (and therefore any fund that held those companies) paid 
improves the return to -9% over the ten year period. Annualized, that’s -0.95% 
per year with dividends vs. -2.71% without. It’s still not attractive, not even 
positive, but much better than without dividends. </p>
<p>Second, a look at how the last eight decades have performed gives a sense of 
the volatility of the stock market. The chart below shows the annualized S&amp;P 500 
return (including dividends) over each ten-year period. While the 2000’s were 
the worst of all the decades shown, they’re not far behind the 1930’s. Had one 
reached the conclusion that long-term investing was dead after 1939, the 
opportunity to turn $1 into $1,430 over the next 70 years with an investment in 
the S&amp;P 500 would have been missed. </p>
</font>
<p><img border="0" src="lostde2.gif"></p><font SIZE="2">
<p>Finally, the argument above takes a large leap in using the S&amp;P 500 as an 
approximation for &quot;investing&quot;. Any professional asset manager (including yours 
truly), incorporates many other asset and sub-asset classes into an overall 
portfolio allocation. The ultimate selection is of course based on the return 
that clients need in order to achieve their goals, with the minimum amount of 
risk that is possible to get there. While the S&amp;P 500 certainly performed poorly 
during the 2000s, and just about every asset manager would have had some 
component of client portfolios in large capitalization U.S. stocks (like the S&amp;P 
500), the other asset classes performed much better. </p>
<p>In fact, a simple indexing of equal components of each asset class shown 
below would have led to a 6.85% annualized return throughout the 2000’s (94% 
return over the 10 years!). And, what’s even better is that only two years in 
the 2000’s would have had negative returns. This shows the impact of having a 
truly diversified portfolio, as opposed to one that just contains many stocks in 
the same assets class (as is the case with the S&amp;P 500). </p>
</font>
<p><img border="0" src="lostde3.gif"></p><font SIZE="2">
<p>So, while large cap U.S. stocks may have had a really hard time in the 
2000’s, the nearly 7% compounded returns that could have been achieved with the 
combination of assets above would have satisfied the 10-year goals of many 
investors. In other words, passive investing and goal-based investing focused on 
diversification seems far from dead. </p>
<p>The keys to success are in choosing the right portfolio for your goals, 
adjusting as events in your life warrant, and making sure that not only aren’t 
all your eggs in one basket, but they’re in as many baskets as possible. That 
worked during the bull market run of the 1990’s, during the more stagnant 2000’s 
and we continue to believe it is an investor’s best chance at achieving his/her 
goals in the 2010’s and beyond. &#8718; </p>
