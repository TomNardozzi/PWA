<font face="Verdana" size="2">Meet Mike and Ike Jones, 23-year-old 
twins from Tampa, FL who recently graduated from Clemson University in South 
Carolina.&nbsp; Both are engineers by education and have taken entry-level 
positions with an esteemed construction management company in Atlanta, GA where 
they can make good use of their civil engineering degree.&nbsp; Both Mike and 
Ike have a some college loans outstanding, but are making a decent salary of 
$45,000 / year and are paying loans down as planned.&nbsp; Mike has always been 
a bit more mature than Ike, and has always put building a successful future for 
himself ahead of having the most fun possible in the present.&nbsp; Ike is also 
generally responsible, but tends to focus on today more than tomorrow.&nbsp; As 
they've both been with their company for 2 years now, they've recently qualified 
to start contributing to the firm's 401k retirement plan.&nbsp; While the 
company doesn't match contributions, Mike and Ike both realize the value of 
tax-deferred growth in such a savings plan.&nbsp; Mike decides to immediately 
start contributing to the plan, deferring $5,000 of his salary each year for the 
next ten years.&nbsp; Ike, on the other hand, decides that there is plenty of 
time to save for retirement and decides to wait ten years before contributing.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">At age 33, after 10 years have 
passed, Mike has a dramatic lifestyle change and can no longer contribute to his 
401k as he needs every dollar to pay the bills and support his pregnant wife and 
2-year-old child.&nbsp; He never contributes another dollar to his 401k.&nbsp; 
Ike now at age 33 decides to start contributing and contributes $5,000 per year 
for the next 32 years until both brothers retire at age 65.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's assume both brothers earned an 
average annual return of 10% on their 401k account balance.&nbsp; After 32 years 
of contributions and that 10% annual growth, Ike's account balance would be just 
over $1.1 million dollars.&nbsp; But, with only 10 years of contributions and 
earning that same 10% per year, Mike's account balance is $1.85 million dollars!&nbsp; 
Even though he put significantly less into the account over 42 years, the fact 
that Mike started contributing early allowed the &quot;miracle&quot; of compounding to 
produce 66% more money for retirement than his brother.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The lesson here is clear.&nbsp; Start 
saving early in life and you wind up letting your money work for you longer.&nbsp; 
The longer your money's working for you, the less time you'll have to spend 
working for your money.</font></p>
