<font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#FDF1CC">Why Choose A CERTIFIED FINANCIAL 
PLANNER™ Professional</font></span></h2>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Did you know that today anyone can claim to be a 
“financial planner”? It’s true. But not just anyone can call himself or herself 
a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional.&nbsp; As a consumer, it’s important 
to understand the difference. Allow me to take this opportunity to explain why.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">I have earned the right to call myself a CFP® 
professional because I have voluntarily agreed to meet rigorous education, 
examination and experience standards. I participate in ongoing professional 
education. And, I follow a strict code of professional ethics and standards of 
practice.&nbsp; The standards I adhere to are promulgated and enforced by 
Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc.&nbsp; The CFP Board refers 
to these standards as “the 4Es.”</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Education. I completed an education 
	requirement to demonstrate to CFP Board that I have the theoretical and 
	practical financial planning knowledge to practice personal financial 
	planning. In addition, every two years, I complete a minimum of 30 hours of 
	continuing education to stay current with developments in the field. </font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Examination. I passed an exam administered by 
	CFP Board to test my understanding of the financial planning process, tax 
	planning, employee benefits, retirement planning, estate planning, 
	investment management and insurance. </font></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Experience. Before earning the CFP</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">®</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> 
	certification, I fulfilled a minimum of three years’ experience in the 
	financial planning process.</font></li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Ethics. I agree to abide by CFP Board’s “Code 
	of Ethics and Professional Responsibility.” The “Code of Ethics” requires 
	CFP</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">®</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> 
	certificants to act fairly and diligently, with integrity and objectivity, 
	when providing financial planning services to clients. I also have agreed to 
	submit to background checks by CFP Board and have promised to disclose any 
	investigation or legal proceedings related to my professional or business 
	conduct. </font></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are looking for a measure of a financial planner’s commitment to ethical 
behavior and adherence to high professional standards … if you are looking for a 
financial planner who will put you and your needs at the center of every 
financial planning engagement … I suggest that you look for a CFP</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">®</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> 
professional. <br>
